For my final project, I want to create an adaptation of the snake game using Cinder. 
The snake game is a classic, and is relatively easy to pick up in terms of gameplay rules. 
At minimum, the user would need to be able to control their snake using arrow keys, collect food to get bigger, and not crash into themselves or walls when moving around.

In terms of background knowledge, this project seems to incorporate knowledge we have used this semester to do our ideal-gas simulations and linked lists.
It'd be pretty fun to create, and there are several interesting features I could add to the project. I want to create a game because I will be able to see a tangible and interactive result at the end of it.

By the end of week 1, I hope to have basic functionality done for the game. This would include having a snake that can move on a grid, adding length to the snake when it eats 'food,' and letting the snake turn properly within the board.

By the end of week 2, the game should terminate when the snake bumps into walls or itself. I think another cool feature to add would be 
allowing either the entire snake or segments of the snake to change colors depending on the color of the food tiles it eats.

By the end of week 3, I aim to be adding more nonstandard features. One could be having food tiles which move, or 'danger' tiles which the snake cannot bump into randomly generate into the board.
In terms of extra 'stretch' goals I could implement, I could make the game have two snakes at once (using different keys to control each at the same time). Another option could be implementing a more maze-like board which the snake has to navigate through or a moving board. Another feature could be adding a tile which would shorten the snake's length.
